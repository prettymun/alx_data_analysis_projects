    "This problem involves pulling data from multiple tables (`Customers`, `Orders`, `OrderDetails`, and `Products`) to create a detailed report. It's testing your ability to use `JOINS`, aggregate functions, grouping, and the `HAVING` clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how to break down the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify the tables you need to pull data from**: For this problem, you'll need data from the `Customers`, `Orders`, `OrderDetails`, and `Products` tables.\n",
    "2. **Join these tables**: Use SQL joins to connect these tables. The `Orders` table is connected to `Customers` via `CustomerID`. The `OrderDetails` table is connected to `Orders` via `OrderID` and to `Products` via `ProductID`.\n",
    "3. **Filter the data**: Use the `WHERE` clause to filter orders to only include those from the last quarter ('2023-04-01' to '2023-06-30').\n",
    "4. **Aggregate the data**: Aggregate functions are needed to calculate the total amount spent by each customer (SUM of `Quantity` * `UnitPrice`) and the total quantity of each product purchased by each customer (`SUM` of `Quantity`). This is done in the `SELECT` clause.\n",
    "5. **Group the data**: Use the `GROUP BY` clause to segment the data by `CustomerName`, `Country`, and `ProductName`.\n",
    "6. **Apply a condition on an aggregate:** Lastly, use the `HAVING` clause to include only customers who have spent more than 5000 in the last quarter. Remember, when you want to use a condition on an aggregate, you should use the `HAVING` clause, not the `WHERE` clause. The `WHERE` clause is used to filter rows, while the `HAVING` clause is used to filter groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is a detailed report with customer names, their countries, the total amount spent by each customer, the list of products each customer purchased, and the total quantity of each product purchased by each customer for the last quarter. Only customers who spent more than 5000 are included."
