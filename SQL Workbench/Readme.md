Project Summary: Maji Ndogo - Part 1
- This project is based on a data exploration initiative for Maji Ndogo, a fictional community facing a water crisis. A large-scale survey was conducted, resulting in a rich database of over 60,000 records collected by engineers, field workers, scientists, and analysts. The goal of the project was to extract meaningful insights from the data to support data-driven decisions for improving water access and quality.
- As part of the analysis, I used SQL Workbench. I applied basic SQL commands, including SELECT, WHERE, UPDATE, SET, LIKE, LIMIT, CREATE TABLE, and DROP TABLE to explore and manipulate the dataset.

Key tasks and objectives:
- Get to Know the Data: Identified all foundational tables in the database and explored their structure using SHOW TABLES and SELECT * queries.
- Dive into Water Sources: Queried water source types to understand the categories and accessibility of water sources in Maji Ndogo.
- Unpack Visits: Analyzed the visits table to discover visit patterns, particularly focusing on visit frequency and queue times.
- Assess Water Quality: Evaluated the quality of water sources based on subjective scores, identifying those frequently visited with varying quality levels.
- Investigate Pollution Issues: Queried contamination data in wells to detect inconsistencies, corrected errors in descriptive fields using string operations, and updated inaccurate classifications using conditional logic.

This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to explore real-world survey data, clean and correct errors, and derive actionable insights in the context of public resource management.
