    "The SQL query retrieves a list of artist names and album titles, highlighting both eponymous albums (albums with the same name as the artist) and non-eponymous albums. It achieves this by using a combination of `LEFT JOIN` and `UNION ALL` to combine the results of two separate queries. The first query joins the `artists` and `albums` tables by matching the artist's name with the album title, while the second query joins the `albums` and `artists` tables with the same condition. This approach effectively emulates a `FULL OUTER JOIN`, ensuring that all eponymous and non-eponymous albums are included in the final result."
